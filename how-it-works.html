					<h2>Our Leaf Free Gutters System</h2>
					<p><strong>Benefits</strong><br> Leaf Free Gutters’ design allows water to enter the gutter while keeping leaves and debris out. The design allows our Leaf Free system to be custom-fit to any home by adjusting to any roof pitch. <br>Our low profile design beautifies the look of your home by blending your gutters with the shingles and hiding unsightly metal flashing. It will add to the curb appeal and overall value of your home.<br> Leaf Free Gutters are installed under the drip edge – not under your shingles! Many systems on the market today are installed under the shingles, which allows water to collect and will – over time – begin to mold and rot your roof.<br> The Leaf Free Gutter system is designed specifically to fit your roof line bends and pitch to insure precise alignment and performance for a lifetime. The strategically perforated hood and flow reducers are ideal to handle the heaviest rains and keep debris, birds and other pests out.<br> Our 5″ trough design prevents standing water, in which seeds and insect larvae might collect, by efficiently channeling all water to the downspouts. Our 5 point mounting system guarantees that your Leaf Free Gutter system will never pull away from your roof, thereby maintaining a seamless and uniform appearance.<br>Leaf Free Gutter systems utilize Premium Grade .032 Aluminum which insures that your system will not rust or deteriorate, and will maintain it’s ‘new’ look for the life of your home.</p><br><p><strong>No Hangers or Brackets!</strong> Leaf Free Gutters do not install over additional hangers or brackets that can move or shift over time. The panels are only screwed into the lip of the gutter, and not into the roof or fascia.<br><strong>Easy to Repair -</strong> Panels can easily be replaced in the event that they are damaged by falling tree limbs, and the flexible aluminum design allows for easy alteration should you decide to add on to your home. Many other leaf guard systems on the market today are very expensive because they are only offered through costly franchise businesses. Leaf Free Gutter is much more cost effective since it is our own design.</p>
